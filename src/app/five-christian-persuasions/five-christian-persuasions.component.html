  1. THE AIM OF CHURCH TITHING
  </div>
  <div class="heading_sub">Knowing and relating to God personally</div>
  <div class="text_body">
    Building and cultivating personal relationship with God.<br>
    The aim of Church Tithing is to build strong personal relationship with God, by cultivating the integrity of his personal presence in our lives. 
<br>
It comes from the tithing of Abraham in Genesis 14. Melchizedek’s declaration in Genesis 14:19–20 revealed the personal nature of God and His personal presence and influence in our lives to Abraham. And so, by the declaration of Melchizedek, Abraham came to know that God is personal, and that He can be related to personally. indicating that his tithing was a pursuit of building and cultivating personal relationship with God. Following his tithing, the nature of Abraham’s relations with God changed from impersonal manner to that of a person to person relations with God. The scripture registered that change by the following examples: 

<ol>
 <li>	God established an everlasting covenant with him, as between two persons. </li>
<li>	Abraham no longer built altars in relating to God </li>
<li>	Abraham began having person to person conversations with God </li>
</ol>


  </div>

  <p>In Church tithing, we are making a pursuit of building and cultivating our personal relations with God.

          <div class="text_body">
            The objective of Church Tithing is to acknowledge God’s personal influence in our lives, demonstrating that He is the source of our lives.
It comes from the tithing of Abraham in Genesis 14. He learned from Melchizedek that God was the one who personally gave his enemies into his hands, when he went to the battle against the kings; and that revealed the personal nature of God and His personal influence in his life. Abraham gave tithes of all, when he gained this knowledge about God in his life, for the establishment of the objective of Church tithing, as the father of the Church. In Church tithing, we are glorifying God as the source of our lives, even the honorable things we do to earn for our living on earth.

  3. THE GOAL OF CHURCH TITHING
  </div>
  <div class="heading_sub">Making it count for growth in your personal relations from God</div>
  <div class="text_body">
 Opitimizing your personal relations with God
 <br>
 The goal of Church Tithing is to experience increase in the integrity of God’s presence in our lives, growing in our trusting, and loving relations with Him, and being more holy to Him.
It comes from the tithing of Abraham in Genesis 14. Before his tithing, it was obvious that Abraham was wealthy, but poorer in his spiritual and personal relations with God. Following his tithing, the scripture registered that he was still wealthy, but became richer in his spiritual and personal relations with God, marked by the increasing integrity of God’s personal presence and influence in his life, and observable growth in his trusting, and loving relations with God, and in his holiness to Him. As the father of the Church, the exponential growth in his spiritual and personal relations with God benchmarks these outcomes following his tithing as the goal for Church tithing. In Church tithing, we are optimizing growth in our trusting and loving relations with God, and being holy to Him.

          <div class="text_body">
            Optimizing the economic vitality of the Local Church.<br>
            The purpose of Church tithing is to resource the economic demands of the High Priestly Ministry of Christ on earth, by and for the Church.
It comes from the pattern God established with the tithing of Abraham to Melchizedek, and the tithing of the Israelites to the Aaronic Levitical priesthood. This pattern indicates that Church tithing was an envisioned purpose of God to serve as a unique type of giving to cater for the demands for the living upkeep/necessities that come with the administration of the High Priestly ministry of Christ on earth, by and for the Church. Today, the substance of what is given is in the form of money and or other in-kind physical properties. As the demand for the living upkeep/necessities are catered for, the Church is economically equipped to carry forth with her mandate of God for the birthing, nurturing, and the maturing of Church tithers in their Christian life. In Church tithing, we are uniquely giving for the monetary/in-kind resourcing of the High Priestly Ministry of Christ to the Church, on earth.

  5. THE SACRED SIGNIFICANCE OF CHURCH TITHING
  </div>
  <div class="heading_sub">Dedicating your life to God</div>
  <div class="text_body">
Living and serving God alone
 <br>
The sacred significance of Church tithing is to consecrate our lives to God, keeping our dedication to live and to serve him alone.
It is rooted in the tithing of Abraham in Genesis 14. We know Melchizedek consecrated Abraham, when he received his tithes, based on the patriarch’s admission to the king of Sodom: “I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine,” (Genesis 14:22-23). When did Abraham lift his hand to the Lord? The phrase ‘the Most High God, the possessor of heaven and earth’ were part of the words Melchizedek had used to address Abraham to suggest that the patriarch most likely took that vow of consecration during their encounter, when he tithed. About the consecration to live and to serve God only, Abraham also took the sacred stance to separate himself from the world and its lust (represented by the king of Sodom). In Church tithing, we are distancing ourselves from the lustful things of the world, dedicating our lives to live and to serve God alone.
