What do you know concerning the Goal of Church tithing? 
</h4>
    <p>
1). It is Abrahamâ€™s tithing that gives us the goal of Church tithing, by the occurrence of growth in his trusting and loving relations with God, following the giving of his tithes to Melchizedek
</p>

<ul class="it">
    <li>True</li>
    <li>False</li>
</ul>

<p>2). What scriptural indications are there that Abraham was relatively poorer in his personal relations with God, before he gave his tithes?
</p>
<ul class="it">
    <li>A. His association with the king of Sodom, offering a peace treaty with the Canaanites  
    </li>
    <li>B. Following his tithing, he became wealthy in gold and cattle
    </li>
    <li>C. He will build an altar, when God appears to him. Compromises on Sarah, not consulting God, before going to the battle
    </li>
</ul>

<p>3). Following his tithing Abraham will no longer build altars in his relations with God. Instead, he began to have personal conversations with God.
</p>

<ul class="it">
    <li>True</li>
    <li>False</li>
