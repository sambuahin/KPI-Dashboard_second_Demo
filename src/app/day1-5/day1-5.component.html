<h4 class="question">
  What do you know concerning the Aim of Church tithing? 
 
</h4>
    <p>
1). It is Abraham’s tithing that gives us the aim of Church tithing, when he got to know from Melchizedek that God is personal and can be related to personally.
</p>

<ul class="it">
    <li>True</li>
    <li>False</li>
</ul>

<p>2). What indication is there that the aim of Abraham’s tithing was a pursuit of building and cultivating personal relationship with God?
</p>
<ul class="it">
    <li>A. Following his tithing, Abraham began to have personal conversations with God, instead of building altars
    </li>
    <li>B. He went to his father’s house in Haran to share his great benefits in obeying God
    </li>
    <li>C. Following his tithing, he became wealthy in gold and cattle
    </li>
</ul>

<p>3). As the father of the Church, it is Abraham’s tithing that gives us the foundation and the legitimacy for Church tithing.
</p>

<ul class="it">
    <li>True</li>
